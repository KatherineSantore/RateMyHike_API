The RateMyHike app is a solution for hikers who want to keep track of the
  locations that they have hiked and what they thought of that hike. With so
  many locations and the length of time between hikes, hikers can easily lose
  track of which places they have visited and what they thought of each location.
  Now with Rate My Hike there is an easy way to keep track of where you have
  hiked and what you thought of it!

 In future iterations I want to integreate a Google API to show location on a
 Google Map.
