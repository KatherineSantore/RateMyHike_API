I wanted to create an app where a user could log in and create posts about their
hikes. I also wanted them to be able to see posts created by other users in their area.

I created an app where the user can log in and create posts. They can update and delete
their posts. Also, they can view posts created by others.

 In future iterations I want to integreate a Google API to show location on a
 Google Map.
